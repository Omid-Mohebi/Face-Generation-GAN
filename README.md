# DCGAN for CelebA Face Generation

This project is a **Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN)** built with TensorFlow and Keras. It is trained on the **CelebA (CelebFaces Attributes) dataset** to generate new, realistic 64x64 celebrity faces.

## Generated Examples

Here are some examples of faces generated by the model after 100 epochs of training.

## Model Architecture

The model consists of two core components: a Generator and a Discriminator.

### 1. Generator

The Generator takes a 100-dimension latent vector (random noise) and upsamples it through a series of `Conv2DTranspose` (deconvolution) layers to produce a 64x64x3 image.



### 2. Discriminator

The Discriminator is a standard convolutional neural network (CNN) that takes a 64x64x3 image (either real from the dataset or fake from the generator) and acts as a binary classifier. It outputs a single value indicating whether it believes the image is "real" (1) or "fake" (0).

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

You will need Python 3.x and the packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPO-NAME.git](https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPO-NAME.git)
    cd YOUR-REPO-NAME
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install the required packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## How to Run

There are two ways to run this project:

### 1. Jupyter Notebook (Recommended)

The `dcgan.ipynb` notebook contains the full code with step-by-step execution. This is the best way to visualize the data and experiment with the model.

1.  Start Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
2.  Open `dcgan.ipynb` and run the cells.

### 2. Python Script

You can run the entire training process directly from your terminal.

```bash
python dcgan.py
```
